### Project Setup Instructions
To set up and run this project, you'll need to ensure that you are in the project's main directory. Once you're in the main directory, run the Python application by executing the main.py file. You can do this by entering 'python main.py' in the terminal.

Upon executing the main.py script, the application will start running in two separate threads. The first thread acts as the master, and the second one operates as the agent. The master application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000. This address serves as the entry point for the admin login page, where you can manage and oversee the system's operations. Additionally, the agent application will be available at https://127.0.0.1:5001. This address serves as the login page for both customers and engineers, providing access to the respective functionalities of the application.
